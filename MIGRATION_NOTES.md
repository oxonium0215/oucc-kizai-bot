# Migration Notes - Quota and Class Feature Removal

This document explains the removal of undocumented features from the OUCC Equipment Lending Bot to achieve strict alignment with the official documentation.

## Overview

**Migration**: `009_remove_quota_and_class_features.sql`  
**Date**: November 2024  
**Reason**: Remove features not specified in official documentation to maintain doc-driven development

## Removed Features

### 1. User Quota System
**Tables Removed:**
- `quota_settings` - Guild-level reservation limits
- `quota_role_overrides` - Role-based quota overrides  
- `quota_override_audits` - Audit log for admin quota bypasses

**Functionality Removed:**
- Per-guild reservation count limits
- Time-based limits (7-day, 30-day hour totals)
- Role-based quota overrides (more permissive limits for certain roles)
- Admin quota override capabilities with audit logging
- Quota validation in reservation creation/modification flows

### 2. Equipment Class System
**Tables Removed:**
- `equipment_classes` - Equipment categorization with specific limits
- `quota_class_overrides` - Class-specific quota settings

**Schema Changes:**
- Removed `class_id` column from `equipment` table
- Removed class-based quota constraints (duration limits, lead time requirements)

**Functionality Removed:**
- Equipment class organization with emojis and descriptions
- Class-specific reservation duration limits
- Class-specific minimum/maximum lead time requirements
- Class-based quota calculations combining role and class overrides
- Class selection UI in equipment management
- Class badges and display in equipment embeds

### 3. Code Removal
**Source Files Removed:**
- `src/quotas.rs` - Quota calculation and validation logic
- `src/quota_validator.rs` - Integration layer for quota checks
- `src/class_manager.rs` - Equipment class management

**Test Files Removed:**
- `tests/quota_tests.rs` - Quota system unit tests
- `tests/quota_validator_tests.rs` - Quota validation integration tests
- `tests/equipment_class_tests.rs` - Equipment class functionality tests

**Modified Files:**
- `src/models.rs` - Removed quota and class-related data structures
- `src/handlers.rs` - Removed quota validation from reservation flows
- `src/equipment.rs` - Removed class_id handling and display
- `src/lib.rs` - Removed module references

## Data Safety

### What Data Is Preserved
✅ **All core reservation data** - No impact on existing reservations  
✅ **Equipment data** - Names, status, locations preserved (class_id removed)  
✅ **User data** - No impact on user accounts or permissions  
✅ **Audit logs** - equipment_logs table remains intact  
✅ **Tag system** - Equipment categorization still available  

### What Data Is Lost
❌ **Quota configurations** - All quota settings and overrides  
❌ **Equipment class definitions** - Class names, emojis, descriptions  
❌ **Class assignments** - Equipment-to-class associations  
❌ **Quota audit history** - Records of admin quota overrides  

## Migration Process

The migration uses a **safe table recreation strategy** for removing the `class_id` column from equipment:

1. **Create temporary table** without `class_id` column
2. **Copy all data** except `class_id` to temporary table  
3. **Drop original table** and constraints
4. **Recreate table** with new schema
5. **Restore data** from temporary table
6. **Drop temporary table** and recreate indexes

This approach ensures data integrity and handles foreign key constraints properly.

## Rollback Strategy

⚠️ **No automated rollback available** - This migration removes tables and data permanently.

### Rollback Options

1. **Database Backup Restore**
   - Restore from backup taken before migration
   - Will lose any data created after backup

2. **Git Checkout Previous Version**
   ```bash
   git checkout <commit-before-migration>
   ```
   - Restore codebase to pre-migration state
   - Database will need manual schema restoration

3. **Manual Recreation** *(Not Recommended)*
   - Manually recreate dropped tables
   - Re-add removed columns to equipment table
   - Will lose all quota/class configuration data

## Testing After Migration

### Verify Core Functionality
- [ ] Equipment reservations work normally
- [ ] Equipment display shows correct information (no class badges)
- [ ] Tag-based organization still functions
- [ ] Admin management panel works
- [ ] Transfer functionality unaffected
- [ ] Notification system operational

### Verify Removal
- [ ] No quota validation errors in reservation flows
- [ ] No class-related UI elements appear
- [ ] No references to removed tables in logs
- [ ] Database queries don't reference dropped columns

### Run Test Suite
```bash
cargo test
```

All tests should pass after removing quota/class-specific test files.

## Post-Migration Checklist

- [ ] Update any documentation mentioning removed features
- [ ] Remove any remaining UI references to quotas or classes
- [ ] Update admin documentation about available features
- [ ] Inform users about removed functionality
- [ ] Monitor logs for any related errors

## Impact Assessment

### Users
- **Positive**: Simplified, more focused feature set
- **Neutral**: No impact on core equipment lending workflows
- **Negative**: Loss of quota controls for high-traffic guilds

### Administrators  
- **Positive**: Fewer configuration options to manage
- **Neutral**: Tag-based organization still available
- **Negative**: No automatic enforcement of usage limits

### Developers
- **Positive**: Cleaner codebase aligned with documentation
- **Positive**: Reduced complexity in reservation logic
- **Positive**: Easier to understand and maintain

## Future Considerations

If quota or class functionality is needed in the future:

1. **Document first** - Add clear specifications to README.md
2. **Design review** - Ensure integration with existing systems  
3. **Migration plan** - Plan for re-adding without breaking existing data
4. **Test coverage** - Comprehensive tests before implementation

## Support

For issues related to this migration:

1. Check logs for any references to removed tables/columns
2. Verify database migration completed successfully
3. Ensure all removed source files are not referenced
4. Contact development team if core functionality is affected

---

**Migration Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Data Loss**: ⚠️ Quota and class configuration data  
**Core Impact**: ✅ None - all documented features preserved  
**Rollback**: ⚠️ Manual backup restoration only  

*This migration is part of establishing documentation-driven development practices.*
